# Neural Machine Translation

## Requirements

All required packages are located in requirements.txt file. To install them, just run the command below in your terminal.
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
I also recommend to use a GPU. This work is done Google Colab.

## I. Seq2Seq Model Baseline

## II. Seq2Seq Model with Attention Mechanisms

## III. Convolutional Seq2Seq Model

## VI. Transformer Model
