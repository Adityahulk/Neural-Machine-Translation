# Neural Machine Translation

## Requirements

All required packages are located in requirements.txt file. To install them, just run the command below in your terminal.

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

I also recommend to use a GPU. This work is done Google Colab.

## 1. Seq2Seq Model with LSTM

## 2. Seq2Seq Model with BiLSTM

## 3. Seq2Seq Model with Luong Attention

## 4. Seq2Seq Model with Badhanau Attention

## 5. Convolutional Seq2Seq Model

## 6. Transformer Model
