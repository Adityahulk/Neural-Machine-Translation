        "\n",
        "A large number of experts have underlined that these are expected in a small number of cases — and that these ought not to dissuade people from taking the shot.\n",

        "Dr Shashank Joshi, member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, said both the vaccines being used in India, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, a version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, are absolutely safe — and minor side-effects are expected in some cases, not just for these particular vaccines, but any other vaccine as well.\n",

        "Before vaccination\n",
        "👉 In case a person has allergies to medication, or drugs, it is important to get an all-clear from a medical practitioner. A complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), or Immunoglobulin-E (IgE) levels can be checked under medical advice.\n",
        "\n",
        "👉 One should eat well and take medicines, if prescribed, ahead of vaccination. One should try to be as relaxed as possible; counselling can help people who are feeling anxious.\n",
        "\n",
        "👉 People with diabetes or blood pressure need to keep these in check. Cancer patients, especially those on chemotherapy, must act on medical advice.\n",
        "\n",
        "👉 People who have received blood plasma or monoclonal antibodies as part of Covid-19 treatment, or those who have been infected in the last one and a half months are advised to not take the vaccine right now.\n",
        "\n",
        "📣 JOIN NOW 📣: The Express Explained Telegram Channel\n",
        "After vaccination\n",
        "👉 A recipient of the vaccine is monitored at the vaccine centre itself to guard against any immediate severe allergic reaction. People are allowed to leave only after it has been ascertained that this is not the case.\n",
        "\n",
        "👉 Side effects like pain at the injection site and fever are common. This is no reason to panic. Some other side effects like chills and fatigue might also be expected, but these go away in a few days.\n",

        "Important to note\n",
        "🔴 Vaccines teach our immune system how to recognise and fight an external threat — in this case, the virus that causes Covid-19. It typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to build protection (immunity) against the virus.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔴 This means that a person could still get infected by Covid-19 in the few days immediately following the vaccination, because the person would not have had enough time to develop immunity.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔴 Therefore, basic precautionary measures must be followed even after vaccination. Face masks, hand hygiene, and physical distancing in public places must not be abandoned just because a vaccine has been taken. Cough/sneeze etiquette also needs to be followed.\n",

            "Virat Kohli ( Hindustani: [ʋɪˈraːʈ ˈkoːɦliː] (); born 5 November 1988) is an Indian cricketer and the current captain of the India national team. A right-handed top-order batsman, Kohli is regarded as one of the best contemporary batsmen in the world.[3] He plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL), and has been the team's captain since 2013. Kohli is consistently rated as one of the top-ranked batsmen in the world, according to the ICC Player Rankings. Among Indian batsmen, Kohli has his best ever Test rating (937 points), ODI rating (911 points) and T20I rating (897 points).\n",
            "\n",
            "Kohli captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. After a few months later, he made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular in the ODI middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup. He made his Test debut in 2011 and shrugged off the tag of \"ODI specialist\" by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South Africa.[4] Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time in 2013,[5] Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016).\n",
            "\n",
            "Kohli was appointed the vice-captain of the ODI team in 2012 and handed over the Test captaincy following Mahendra Singh Dhoni's Test retirement in 2014. In early 2017, he became the limited-overs captain as well after Dhoni stepped down from the position. In ODIs, Kohli has the second highest number of centuries and the highest number of centuries in run-chases in the world. He holds the world record for being the fastest batsman to 8,000, 9,000, 10,000,11,000 and 12,000 runs in ODI cricket, reaching the milestones in 175, 194, 205 , 222 and 242 innings respectively.[6][7] [8][9][10] Kohli has been the recipient of many awards such as the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy (ICC Cricketer of the Year) in 2017 and 2018; ICC Test Player of the Year 2018; ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2012, 2017 and 2018 and Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2016, 2017 and 2018.[11] He was given the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri under the sports category in 2017[12] and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, the highest sporting honour in India, in 2018.[13] Kohli is ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN[14] and one of the most valuable athlete brands by Forbes.[15] In 2018, Time magazine named Kohli one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[16] In 2020, Kohli was ranked 66th in Forbes list of the top 100 highest paid athletes in the world for the year 2020 with estimated earnings of $26 million. Virat Kohli is the only cricketer to feature in Forbes.[17] In March 2021, Kohli became the first Asian celebrity to reach 100 million followers on Instagram.[18]\n",

            "Early life\n",
            "\n",
            "Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family.[19] His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, is a housewife.[20] He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhavna.[21] According to his family, when he was three-years old, Kohli would pick up a cricket bat, start swinging it and ask his father to bowl at him.[22]\n",
            "\n",
            "Kohli was raised in Uttam Nagar[23] and started his schooling at Vishal Bharti Public School. In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created and a nine-year-old Kohli was part of its first intake.[23] Kohli's father took him to the academy after their neighbours suggested that \"Virat shouldn't waste his time in gully cricket and instead join a professional club\".[20] Kohli trained at the academy under Rajkumar Sharma and also played matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy at Vasundhara Enclave at the same time.[23] Sharma recounts Kohli's early days at his academy, \"He oozed talent. It was so difficult to keep him quiet. He was a natural in whatever he did and I was most impressed with his attitude. He was ready to bat at any spot, and I had to literally push him home after the training sessions. He just wouldn’t leave.\"[24] In ninth grade, he shifted to Saviour Convent in Paschim Vihar to help his cricket practice.[20] Apart from sports, Kohli was good at academics as well, and his teachers remember him as \"a bright and alert child\".[25] Kohli's family lived in Meera Bagh until 2015 when they moved to Gurgaon.[26]\n",
            "\n",
            "Kohli's father died on 18 December 2006 due to a stroke after being bed-ridden for a month.[20] Regarding his early life, Kohli has said in an interview, \"I've seen a lot in life. Losing my father at a young age, the family business not doing too well, staying in a rented place. There were tough times for the family... It's all embedded in my memory.\"[27] According to Kohli, his father supported his cricket training during his childhood, \"My father was my biggest support. He was the one who drove me to practice every day. I miss his presence sometimes.\"[28]\n",

            "Kohli first played for Delhi Under-15 team in October 2002 in the 2002–03 Polly Umrigar Trophy. He was the leading run-scorer for his team in that tournament with 172 runs at an average of 34.40.[29] He became the captain of the team for the 2003–04 Polly Umrigar Trophy[30] and scored 390 runs in 5 innings at an average of 78 including two centuries and two fifties.[31] In late 2004, he was selected in the Delhi Under-17 team for the 2003–04 Vijay Merchant Trophy. He scored 470 runs in four matches at an average of 117.50 with two hundreds and top-score of 251*.[32] Delhi Under-17s won the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy in which Kohli finished as the highest run-scorer with 757 runs from 7 matches at an average of 84.11 with two centuries.[33] In February 2006, he made his List A debut for Delhi against Services but did not get to bat.[34]\n",
            "\n",
            "In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s[35] and 49 in the three-match Test series.[36] India Under-19 went on to win both the series. At the conclusion of the tour, the India Under-19 coach Lalchand Rajput was impressed with Kohli and said, \"Kohli showed strong technical skills against both pace and spin\".[37] In September, the India Under-19 team toured Pakistan. Kohli averaged 58 in the Test series[38] and 41.66 in the ODI series against Pakistan Under-19s.[39]\n",

            "\"The way I approached the game changed that day. I just had one thing in my mind - that I have to play for my country and live that dream for my dad.\" — Kohli on his innings against Karnataka[40]\n",
            "\n",
            "Kohli made his first-class debut for Delhi against Tamil Nadu in November 2006, at the age of 18, and scored 10 in his debut innings. He came into the spotlight in December when he decided to play for his team against Karnataka on the day after his father's death and went on to score 90.[41] He went directly to the funeral after he was dismissed. Delhi captain Mithun Manhas said, \"That is an act of great commitment to the team and his innings turned out to be crucial,\" while coach Chetan Chauhan lauded Kohli's \"attitude and determination.\"[42] His mother noted that \"Virat changed a bit after that day. Overnight he became a much more matured person. He took every match seriously. He hated being on the bench. It's as if his life hinged totally on cricket after that day. Now, he looked like he was chasing his father's dream which was his own too.\"[20] He scored a total of 257 runs from 6 matches at an average of 36.71 in that season.[43]\n",
            "\n",
            "In April 2007, he made his Twenty20 debut and finished as the highest run-getter for his team in the Inter-State T20 Championship with 179 runs at an average of 35.80.[44] In July–August 2007, the India Under-19 team toured Sri Lanka. In the triangular series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, Kohli was the second highest run-getter with 146 runs from 5 matches.[45] In the two-match Test series that followed, he scored 244 runs at an average of 122 including a hundred and a fifty.[46]\n",
            "\n",
            "\"He is a very physical type of player. He likes to impose himself on the game, backs it up with his skill.\" — India's coach at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup Dav Whatmore on Kohli[40]\n",
            "\n",
            "In February–March 2008, Kohli captained the victorious Indian team at the 2008 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia. Batting at number 3, he scored 235 runs in 6 matches at an average of 47 and finished as the tournament's third-highest run-getter and one of the three batsmen to score a hundred in the tournament.[47] His century (100 runs from 74 balls) against the West Indies Under-19s in the group stage, which was called \"the innings of the tournament\" by ESPNcricinfo,[48] gave India a 50-run victory and earned Kohli the man of the match. Kohli picked up a leg injury during the match, but recovered in time to play the quarter-final match against England Under-19s.[49] He was instrumental in India's three-wicket semi-final win over New Zealand Under-19s in which he took 2/27 and scored 43 in the tense run-chase and was awarded the man of the match.[50] He scored 19 against South Africa Under-19s in the final which India won by 12 runs (D/L method). ESPNcricinfo commended him for making several tactical bowling changes during the tournament.[48]\n",
            "\n",
            "Following the Under-19 World Cup, Kohli was bought by the Indian Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for $30,000 on a youth contract.[51] In June 2008, Kohli and his Under-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border-Gavaskar scholarship. The scholarship allowed the three players to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.[47] In July 2008, he was included in India's 30-man probable squad for the ICC Champions Trophy which was to be held in Pakistan in September 2008.[52] He was also picked in the India Emerging Players squad for the four-team Emerging Players Tournament in Australia. He was in fine form in that tournament and scored 206 runs in six matches at an average of 41.20.[53]\n",

            "In August 2008, Kohli was included in the Indian ODI squad for tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had played only eight List A matches,[54] and his selection was called a \"surprise call-up\".[55] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were injured, Kohli batted as a makeshift opener throughout the series. He made his international debut, at the age of 19, in the first ODI of the tour and was dismissed for 12.[56] He made his first ODI half century, a score of 54, in the fourth match which helped India win the series.[56] He had scores of 37, 25 and 31 in the other three matches.[56] India won the series 3–2 which was India's first ODI series win against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.\n",
            "\n",
            "After the Champions Trophy was postponed to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008.[57] He batted only once in the two-match series, and scored 49 in that innings.[58] Later that month in September 2008, he played for Delhi in the Nissar Trophy against SNGPL (winners of Quaid-i-Azam Trophy from Pakistan) and top-scored for Delhi in both innings, with 52 and 197.[59] The match was drawn but SNGPL won the trophy on first-innings lead.[60] In October 2008, Kohli played for Indian Board President's XI in a four-day tour match against Australia. He made 105 and 16* in that match against a bowling line-up consisting of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza.[61]\n",
            "\n",
            "Kohli was included in the squad for the home ODI series against England in November 2008 but was not given a chance to play, due to the inclusion of Tendulkar and Sehwag in the team.[62] In December 2008, Kohli was given a Grade D contract in the annual BCCI contracts list which entitled him to receive ₹1.5 million (equivalent to ₹3.4 million or US$47,000 in 2019).[63] He was then dropped from the squad for the five-match ODI series in Sri Lanka against Sri Lanka in January 2009.\n",
            "\n",
            "Kohli was selected in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament in July–August 2009 held in Australia. He opened the innings for India Emerging Players in that tournament and finished as the leading run-getter with 398 runs from seven matches at an average of 66.33.[64] He scored 104 off 102 balls in the final against South Africa Emerging Players at Brisbane to help his team win the match by 17 runs and clinch the title.[65] At the conclusion of the tournament, Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of the national selection committee, was impressed with Kohli and remarked \"I must say, opener Virat Kohli was outstanding. Some of the shots he played spoke about his ability.\"[66] Kohli has called this tournament as the \"turning point\" of his career.[67]\n",
            "\n",
            "Kohli returned to the national team replacing the injured Gautam Gambhir in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.[68] He batted at number 4 for India in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy because of an injury to Yuvraj Singh. In the inconsequential group match against the West Indies, Kohli scored an unbeaten 79 in India's successful chase of 130 and won his first man of the match award.[69] Kohli played as a reserve batsman in the seven-match home ODI series against Australia, appearing in two matches as injury replacement. He found a place in the home ODI series against Sri Lanka in December 2009 and scored 27 and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj who regained fitness for the third ODI. However, Yuvraj's finger injury recurred leading to him being ruled out indefinitely.[70] Kohli returned to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata and scored his first ODI century–107 off 111 balls–sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir, who made his personal best score of 150. India won by seven wickets to seal the series 3–1.[56] The man of the match was awarded to Gambhir who gave the award to Kohli.[71]\n",
            "\n",
            "Tendulkar was rested for the tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh in January 2010, which enabled Kohli to play in each of India's five matches. Against Bangladesh, he scored 91 to help secure a win after India collapsed to 51/3 early in their run-chase of 297.[56] In the next match against Sri Lanka, Kohli ended unbeaten on 71 to help India win the match with a bonus point having chased down their target of 214 within 33 overs. The next day, he scored his second ODI century, against Bangladesh, bringing up the mark with the winning runs.[72] He became only the third Indian batsman to score two ODI centuries before their 22nd birthday, after Tendulkar and Suresh Raina.[73] Kohli was much praised for his performances during the series[67][74] in particular by the Indian captain Dhoni.[75] Although Kohli made only two runs in the final against Sri Lanka in a four-wicket Indian defeat,[56] he finished as the leading run-getter of the series with 275 runs from five innings at an average of 91.66.[76] In the three-match ODI series at home against South Africa in February, Kohli batted in two games and had scores of 31 and 57.[56]\n",

Kohli made 168 runs at 42.00 including two fifties,[77] but India suffered three defeats in four matches and crashed out of the series. During the series, Kohli became the fastest Indian batsman to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket.[78] He made his T20I debut against Zimbabwe at Harare and scored an unbeaten 26.[79] Later that month, Kohli batted at 3 in a full-strength Indian team throughout the 2010 Asia Cup and scored a total of 67 runs at an average of 16.75.[80] His struggles with form continued in the tri-series against Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka where he averaged 15.\n",

            "Despite the poor run of form, Kohli was retained in the ODI squad for a three-match series against Australia in October, and in the only completed match of the series at Visakhapatnam, scored his third ODI century–118 off 121 balls–which helped India reach the target of 290 after losing the openers early.[81] Winning the man of the match, he admitted that he was under pressure to keep his place in the team after failures in the two previous series.[82] Part of a largely inexperienced team for the home ODI series against New Zealand, Kohli scored a match-winning 104-ball 105, his fourth ODI hundred and second in succession, in the first game,[83] and followed it up with 64 and 63* in the next two matches.[56] India completed a 5–0 whitewash of New Zealand, while Kohli's performance in the series helped him become a regular in the ODI team[84] and made him a strong contender for a spot in India's World Cup squad.[85] He was India's leading run-scorer in ODIs in 2010, with 995 runs from 25 matches at an average of 47.38 including three centuries.[86]\n",
            "\n",

Days before India's first match of the tournament, Indian captain Dhoni indicated that the in-form Kohli is likely to be preferred over Raina.[88]\n",
            "\n",
            "Kohli played in every match of India's successful World Cup campaign. He scored an unbeaten 100, his fifth ODI century, in the first match against Bangladesh and became the first Indian batsman to score a century on World Cup debut.[90] In the next four group matches he had low scores of 8, 34, 12 and 1 against England, Ireland, Netherlands and South Africa respectively. Having returned to form with 59 against the West Indies, he scored only 24 and 9 in the quarter-final against Australia and semi-final against Pakistan respectively.[56] In the final against Sri Lanka at Mumbai, he scored 35, sharing an 83-run partnership with Gambhir for the third wicket after India had lost both openers within the seventh over chasing 275.[91] This partnership is regarded as \"one of the turning points in the match\",[92] as India went on to win the match by six wickets and lift the World Cup for the first time since 1983.[93]\n",

Kohli was one of three uncapped players in the Test squad.[94] Kohli found success in the ODI series which India won 3–2, with a total of 199 runs at an average of 39.80.[95] His best efforts came in the second ODI at Port of Spain where he won the man of the match for his score of 81 which gave India a seven-wicket victory,[96] and the fifth ODI at Kingston where his innings of 94 came in a seven-wicket defeat.[56] Kohli made his Test debut at Kingston in the first match of the Test series that followed. He batted at 5 and was dismissed for 4 and 15 caught behind by Fidel Edwards in both innings.[97] India went on to win the Test series 1–0 but Kohli amassed just 76 runs from five innings,[98] struggling against the short ball[99] and was particularly troubled by the fast bowling of Edwards, who dismissed him three times in the series.[100]\n",

He found moderate success in the subsequent ODI series in which he averaged 38.80.[102] His score of 55 in the first ODI at Chester-le-Street was followed by a string of low scores in the next three matches.[56] In the last game of the series, Kohli scored his sixth ODI hundred–107 runs off 93 balls–and shared a 170-run third-wicket partnership with Rahul Dravid, who was playing his last ODI, to help India post their first 300-plus total of the tour.[103] Kohli was dismissed hit wicket in that innings which was the only century in the series by any player on either team and earned him praise for his \"hard work\" and \"maturity\".[104] However, England won the match by D/L method and the series 3–0.\n",

In competition with Yuvraj Singh for the number six position,[106] it was not until the final match of the series that Kohli was selected in the team. He scored a pair of fifties in the match,[97] with his first innings score of 52 ensuring India avoided follow-on.[107] India won the subsequent ODI series 4–1 in which Kohli managed to accumulate 243 runs at 60.75.[108] During the series, Kohli scored his eighth ODI century and his second at Visakhapatnam, where he made 117 off 123 balls in India's run-chase of 271,[109] a knock which raised his reputation as \"an expert of the chase\".[110] Kohli ended up as the leading run-getter in ODIs for the year 2011, with 1381 runs from 34 matches at 47.62 and four centuries.[111]\n",

He top-scored in each of India's innings in the third Test at Perth, with 44 and 75, even as India surrendered to their second consecutive innings defeat.[114] In the fourth and final match at Adelaide, Kohli scored his maiden Test century of 116 runs in the first innings; it was the only century scored by an Indian in the series.[115] India suffered a 0–4 whitewash and Kohli, India's top run-scorer in the series, was described as \"the lone bright spot in an otherwise nightmare visit for the tourists\".[116]\n",

Coming in at 0/1, he struck 22 fours and a six in his innings to help India to chase down 330, their highest successful ODI run-chase at the time.[126][127] His knock was the highest individual score in Asia Cup history, the joint-second highest score in an ODI run-chase and the highest individual score against Pakistan in ODIs surpassing previous record of 156 by Brian Lara.[128] Kohli was awarded the man of the match in both matches that India won, but India could not progress to the final of the tournament.\n",

This chase was the second-highest successful run-chase in ODI cricket, while Kohli's knock became the fastest hundred against Australia and the third-fastest in a run-chase.[161] He followed that innings with 68 in the next match at Mohali in another Indian defeat,[56] before the next two matches were washed out by rain. In the sixth ODI at Nagpur, he struck 115 off only 66 balls to help India successfully chase the target of 351 and level the series 2–2 and won the man of the match.[162] He reached the 100-run mark in 61 balls, making it the third-fastest ODI century by an Indian batsman, and also became the fastest batsman in the world to score 17 hundreds in ODI cricket.[163] India clinched the series after winning the last match in which he was run out for a duck.
